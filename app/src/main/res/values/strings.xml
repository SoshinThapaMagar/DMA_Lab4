    <string name="text3">She sells seashells on the seashore,The shells she sells are seashells, I’m sure, For if she sells seashells on the seashore, Then I’m sure she sells seashore shells. The seashells she sells are a terrible sell; And the song is a “sell” also. The authors both say it will go very big But I fear I am all that will go! I’ve suffered from lockjaw, and stickjaw as well, In trying this chorus to sing. It’s making me lisp, but I shay to myshelf, The shong’s sure to go with a shwing. I’m dreaming of seashells when I am in bed,I only wish she would sell matches instead! She sells seashells on the seashore,The shells she sells are seashells, I’m sure,For if she sells seashells on the seashore, Then I’m sure she sells seashore shells.</string>
